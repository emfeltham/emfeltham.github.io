I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.yale.edu) at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu).

At Yale, I am a graduate student researcher in the [Yale Institute for Network Science](https://yins.yale.edu), and a member of the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net).

I work on social networks, causal inference, and computational social science, and behavioral experiments. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals cognize their social networks, risk preferences, and social learning.

Additionally, I hold an MA in [Statistics](https://statistics.yale.edu) from Yale, and undergraduate degrees in [Philosophy](https://www.umass.edu/philosophy/) and [Economics](https://www.umass.edu/economics/) from the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/honors/).
