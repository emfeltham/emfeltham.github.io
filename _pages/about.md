I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Sociology at Yale Univerity](https://sociology.yale.edu).

I am a graduate student researcher in the [Yale Institute for Network Science](https://yins.yale.edu), and am a member of the [Human Nature Lab](https://humannaturelab.net).

I am interested in social networks, causal inference, and computational social science, and behavioral experiments. Specifically, I am interested in how individuals cognize their social networks, risk preferences, and social learning. 

Additionally, I hold an MA in Statistics from Yale, and undergraduate degrees in Philosophy and Economics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
